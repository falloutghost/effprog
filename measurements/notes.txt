## life1 -- life.c @ fc7bc117b24f3b88d3d57f312c957a927b6b9351 ##

* initial version
  - uses flex/bison to read input file
  - uses linked list to manage alive cells => extensive overhead on lookup

## life2 -- life-hash_table.c @ 769acfbfdd37eadebe3ffcead986062649f855c1 ##

* use hash table instead of (singly) linked list for manage alive cells, whereas
  - keys are not stored in buckets => additional level of indirection => not cache friendly
  - bucket chaining on conflict => not cache friendly
  - bucket chains are maintained s.t. they are sorted by keys
    => allows early out when lookup for elements in a bucket chain
  - no auto-growing/rehashing yet => degeneration possible

* removed bison/flex dependency too
  - too complex for this simple task
  - TODO: short performance comparison of readlife()
  
* increased GCC optimization level (from 1 to 2)
  - TODO: short performance comparision between O1 and O2
  
* heavy use of inlining static helper functions
  - TODO: small performance comparision

* compile as 32-bit binary -- small performance improvements on our 64-bit machine (no explanation for that :-/)
  - TODO: short performance comparison of 32-bit vs. 64-bit versions

## life3 -- life-cell_table.c @ 769acfbfdd37eadebe3ffcead986062649f855c1 ##

* implemented custom hash table implementation, whereas
  - keys are stored in buckets => no additional level of indirection for key comparison => cache friendly
  - still bucket chaining on conflict => cache miss on conflict
  - bucket chains are no longer sorted
    - bucket chains rather short => not much value
  - no auto-growing/rehashing yet => degeneration still possible 

## life4+5 -- Life.java & life.cpp @ b244348fed4995961a1166539e611f90a5fe7d3e ##

* same approach as life.c, but with hash table implementations that come with Java/C++
  - Java: HashSet
  - C++ (11): unordered_map

* possible differences: auto growing / rehashing, other conflict handling (open addressing instead of bucket chaining)

## life6+7 -- life-hash_table.c & life-cell_table.c @ f1d12df8f96b66974b3dc9609501b8ee5fd8cde3 ##

* auto-growing / rehashing when a certain load factor is reached

## life8 -- life-cell_table.c @ 45de6184c93ff2dd9686b0a9ddce70abcdf074a1 ##

* use linear probing instead of bucket chaining => cache friendly

## life9 -- life-cell_table.c @ a00f9dcabd9b384729ddde891901d895dcc6c445 ##

* use robin hood hashing
  - TODO: paper reference

## life10 -- Life.java hashlife @ TODO ##
